- build the func for person detection and integrate the offset module with the yolov8 model returning data

- read the precision landing by qgc

## Production Readiness Concerns

### For `offset.py`:
- **Advanced Control Algorithm:** The current proportional control is basic. A PID controller is needed for smoother, more precise, and stable centering, especially in dynamic environments (wind, drone inertia).
- **Robustness to Edge Cases:** Implement graceful handling for large offsets to prevent extreme velocity commands.
- **Unit Testing:** Comprehensive unit tests are required for `calculate_offset` and `calculate_velocity_command` to ensure correct behavior under various inputs.

### For `delivery_sequence` (in `drone_controller.py`):
- **Comprehensive Error Handling and Recovery:**
    - **Camera Failure:** Implement logging, recovery attempts, or safe fallbacks (e.g., return to base, emergency land) if camera reading fails.
    - **No Person Detected (Timeout/Fallback):** Implement a timeout for person detection and define fallback actions (e.g., search pattern, return to safe loiter point, abort mission).
    - **MAVLink Command Failures:** Implement reactions to consistent failures in MAVLink command acknowledgments.
- **State Machine Management:** Implement a clear state machine (e.g., `STATE_SEARCHING_PERSON`, `STATE_CENTERING`, `STATE_DROPPING_PAYLOAD`, `STATE_LANDING`) for robust, readable, and extensible logic.
- **Refined Centering Loop:**
    - Utilize `CENTERING_TIMEOUT` from `config.py` for a more sophisticated exit condition.
    - Add small delays (`time.sleep()`) within the centering loop to prevent busy-waiting and reduce CPU usage.
- **Payload Drop Verification:** Implement a mechanism (e.g., sensor) to confirm the payload has actually left the drone.
- **Landing Verification:** Implement more robust landing checks (e.g., ground contact sensors, consistent low altitude for a duration).
- **Logging and Telemetry:** Replace `print` statements with a proper logging framework and ensure critical events and status updates are transmitted to the base station.
- **Safety Failsafes:** Define and implement failsafes for scenarios like drifting too far from the initial GPS target during centering or exceeding altitude limits.
- **Integration Testing:** Conduct thorough testing of the entire delivery sequence on a real drone (or a highly accurate simulator) under various conditions.
